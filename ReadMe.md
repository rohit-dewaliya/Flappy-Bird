# Flappy Bird - A Classic Arcade Game

Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging arcade game where you control a bird and navigate through a series of pipes by
tapping or pressing a key to make it jump. The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Game logic)
- **Pygame** (Rendering and game mechanics)
- **Custom Sprite Animations** (For bird and pipes)
- **Collision Detection Algorithm** (For game physics)

## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. The bird is affected by gravity and continuously falls.
2. Pressing the spacebar or left mouse button makes the bird jump.
3. Pipes are generated dynamically, moving from right to left.
4. The game detects collisions with pipes and the screen boundaries.
5. The score increases as the bird successfully passes through pipes.
6. The game resets upon collision.

## ✨ Features

- Smooth animations and pixel-art style graphics.
